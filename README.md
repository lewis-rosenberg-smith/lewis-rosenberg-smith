After a long stint as a Sound and Video technician on live events, I've decided to dive in headfirst and pursue my interest in tech. I recently attended a full immersion web development bootcamp at Enspiral Dev Academy in Wellington, NZ and I'm seeking to continue my learning in Full Stack Software Development.
